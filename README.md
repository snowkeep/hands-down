Alen's implemenation is specifically for a [Kyria](https://splitkb.com/)
keyboard and uses CAGS [home-row](https://precondition.github.io/home-row-mods)
modifiers.

I am currently using GACS.  Kmonad doesn't support chords directly, so I don't have any of Alan's chords in kmonad.  The layers are
influenced by Alan's, the layers in the [Miryoku](https://github.com/manna-harbour/qmk_firmware/blob/miryoku/users/manna-harbour_miryoku/miryoku.org) layout and some of my own ideas.  A conventionally-shared keyboard also pretty-much eliminates thumb layer control.  The standalone numpad is currently disabled (use the layer one).  I am very unhappy with the current symbol layer, so expect that to change.

Implementations:
   * kmonad config for a 104-key ANSI Dvorak keyboard with 3 CTRL keys and no capslock.
   * kmonad config for the same keyboard that also modifies symbols and numbers to match [Programmer's Dvorak](https://www.kaufmann.no/roland/dvorak/)

Coming soon:
   * [Iris] keyboard files.

Thoughts
   * I don't like the symbol layer - considering splitting enclosures and the rest of the symbols - it would work on the Iris, but not a conventional keyboard
   * Miryoku's symbol layer is the shift-numbers (conventional mapping) with [] added on the number level - it's a pretty good idea
   * Alan split out enclosures, but the rest of the symbols seem pretty random - I don't see a logical pattern.
   * should the numpad be completely reworked?  There's some ideas [here](https://geekhack.org/index.php?topic=72149.0), but they admit the studies were all from dialing phone numbers.  Should hex symbols be added?  Pure entry, w/ $ and %, or stay with basic calculator layout?

Concerns
   * Programmer Dvorak number ordering is a PITA for desktop switching on tiling window managers.  Maybe it will be easier once I'm used to it?  But that may be the deal-breaker to keep me with a conventional number row - this will also probably stop me from moving to a Kyria.
