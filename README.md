layout.  This layout was designed by R. Alan Reiser and is under a [CC BY-SA 3.0 license](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/).

Alan's implemenation is specifically for a [Kyria](https://splitkb.com/)
keyboard and uses CAGS [home-row](https://precondition.github.io/home-row-mods)
modifiers.  He has a link to the QMK source files and a MacOS Keyboard Layout bundle in his Downloads section.

I am currently using GACS.  Kmonad doesn't support chords directly, so I don't
have any of Alan's chords in kmonad.  The layers are influenced by Alan's, the
layers in the
[Miryoku](https://github.com/manna-harbour/qmk_firmware/blob/miryoku/users/manna-harbour_miryoku/miryoku.org)
layout and some of my own ideas.  A conventionally-shaped keyboard also
pretty-much eliminates thumb layer control.  The standalone numpad is currently
disabled (use the layer one).


There are reference, pg and py implementations for kmonad and MKLC. 
The kmonad pg version has symbols and numbers modified to match [Programmer's Dvorak](https://www.kaufmann.no/roland/dvorak/).  The py version is more like the Workman-P numbers/symbols (regular placement but shift-swapped), however [/{ and ]/} haven't been swapped and :/; have.  That makes it better for Python.
I'm not following Alan's layers in my QMK source, but I'd call it a work-in-progress, so they may converge.  I like what he now has up on his website a lot more than what was in the original QMK source he had linked when I first started with Hands Down.

Implementations:
   * kmonad config for a 104-key ANSI Dvorak keyboard with 3 CTRL keys, capslock and an ESC tap-mod on the home CTRL. (previous version of HD ~2021-04-10)
   * Microsoft Keyboard Layout Creator (no tap mods) (HD # ordering, :/; swap)
   * Iris QMK source (123... # ordering, :/; swap)
